# Sales Data Analysis with Microsoft SQL Server
Project Overview
This  project analyzes sales performance using Microsoft SQL Server with star schema structure.  
The goal is to uncover business insights  such as revenue trends, top-performing products, regional performance, and customer purchasing behavior.
  
The database is designed with:
- **Customer Dimension** – Customer details
- **Product Dimension** – Product details
- **Sales Fact Table** – Transactional sales data

The analysis helps answer business questions like-
- Which customers generate the most revenue?
- Which products are top-selling?
- What are the monthly/quarterly sales trends?

  ##  Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft SQL Server** 
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **CSV/Excel** for dataset storage

Example Analysis Queries

Total revenue generated for each category

SELECT
    p.category,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
    ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;



Total revenue generated by each customer
SELECT
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue

LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

Distribution of sold items across countries

SELECT
    c.country,
    SUM(f.quantity) AS total_sold_items
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY c.country
ORDER BY total_sold_items DESC;
